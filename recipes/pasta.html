  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Hello, pasta lovers. You never need to make box mac and cheese again. Enter this basic White Sauce Pasta! This is a staple recipe in our house. The basic cream sauce is so creamy and full of flavor, and get this: it doesn’t even use cream! All you need is a handful of ingredients you probably already have on hand. It takes just 10 minutes: enough time to make the pasta. Eat it straight up, as a pasta side dish, or add more raw or cooked veggies to the sauce. A quick dinner idea made in minutes!</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>1 pound pasta noodles of any shape: spaghetti, bucatini, penne, riagotni, cavatappi, etc.</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
   <li>2 garlic cloves, grated</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
   <li>2 cups 2% milk</li>
   <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
   <li>¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>Start a pot of well salted water to a boil. Boil the pasta until it is just al dente (start tasting a few minutes before the package recommends: you want it to be tender but still a little firm on the inside; usually around 7 to 8 minutes). Drain.</li>
   <li>Meanwhile, measure out all ingredients in advance; the cooking process happens fast!</li>
   <li>Right after you add the pasta to the pot, start the sauce: In a small or medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the grated garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned.</li>
   <li>Add the flour and whisk constantly for 1 minute to 90 seconds, until bubbly and golden. Do not overcook it: the flour can turn brown within a few seconds. Keep an eye on it!</li>
   <li>Add a splash of milk and whisk it in: the sauce will instantly turn chunky. Constantly whisking, continue to add splashes of milk and whisk them in until the entire quantity is incorporated and the sauce is smooth.</li>
   <li>Reduce the heat and whisk until the sauce thickens and no longer tastes like raw flour, about 5 minutes. Add the salt and Parmesan cheese. Taste and add a pinch or two more salt if desired.</li>
   <li>Drain the pasta, then add the sauce. Add a splash or two of milk to loosen the sauce and stir until you have the right consistency. Taste and a few more pinches of salt, if necessary. (The sauce is best freshly made, so we don’t recommend making it in advance). Serve with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
  </ol>
